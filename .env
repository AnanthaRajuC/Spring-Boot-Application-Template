SITE_TITLE=Spring Boot Application Template
SITE_DESCRIPTION=The only thing better than a Maven archetype is a repo you can fork with everything already setup to speed up the creation of new Spring Boot based Web applications, just fork-and-code. This repository contains a recipe/scaffolding for bootstrapping a Monolithic Web Application with the features & Technology stack listed below. Delete the sample code (or keep it.) and add your own, youâ€™re good to go.
