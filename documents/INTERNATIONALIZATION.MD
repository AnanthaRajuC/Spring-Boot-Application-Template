## Internationalization (i18n)

This app can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Textual elements, such as status messages and the GUI component labels, are not hardcoded in the program. Instead they are stored outside the source code and retrieved dynamically.

Refer `io.github.anantharajuc.sbat.core_backend.config.I18Nconfiguration`. The text elements are stored in `\src\main\resources\i18n` folder.
