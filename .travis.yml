# Travis CI Java documentation can be found in:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/

# We will use Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic beaver). List of options:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#linux
dist: xenial

# This enables the 'defaults' to test java applications:
language: java

# We can specify a list of JDKs to be used for testing
# A list of available JDKs in Trusty can be seed in:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/xenial/#jvm-clojure-groovy-java-scala-support
jdk:
- openjdk8

# git strips the wrapper jar file so we have to force its download during the build
install:
- mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
- ./mvnw install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V

# Each job in Travis CI has several steps:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/job-lifecycle/
# The 'language: java' directive sets up sane defaults to test common java applications
# We use the defaults for installing dependencies, compiling and testing maven applications
# In our case it will be 'mvn install' followed by 'mvn test'

script: "mvn cobertura:cobertura"

# This is to enable CodeCov's coverage
# If a build is successful, the code is submitted for coverage analysis
